        <h3>Revenue Section</h3>
        <p>
            The first section titled "Revenue" indicates that Company's Gross (annual) Profit for the fiscal year ending
            June 30, 2018, was $72.007 billion. It was arrived at by deducting the cost of revenue ($38.353 billion)
            from the total revenue ($110.360 billion) realized by the technology giant during its fiscal year. Around
            35% of Company's total sales went toward costs for revenue generation, while a similar figure for Company W
            was around 75% ($373.396/$500.343).12 It indicates that Company W incurred much higher cost compared to
            Company to generate equivalent sales.

        <h3>Operating Expenses</h3>
        <p>
            The next section called "Operating Expenses" again takes into account the cost of revenue ($38.353 billion)
            and total revenue ($110.360 billion) to arrive at the reported figures. As Company spent $14.726 billion on
            research and development (R&D) and $22.223 billion on Selling General and Administrative Expense (SG&A) the
            Total Operating Expenses is computed by summing all these figures ($38.353 + $14.726 + $22.223) = $75.302
            billion.

        <h3>Income from Continuing Operations</h3>
        <p>
            The next section titled "Income from Continuing Operations" adds net other income or expenses (like one time
            earnings), interest-linked expenses and applicable taxes to arrive at the Net Income From Continuing
            Operations ($16.571 billion) for Company, which is 60% higher than that of Company W ($10.523 billion).
        </p>

    <div class="box" style="background: #FFE4E3;">
        <h3>Non-recurring Events</h3>
        <p>
            After discounting for any non-recurring events, the value of net income applicable to common shares is
            arrived at. Company had a 68% higher net income of $16.571 billion compared to Company W's $9.862 billion.
        </p>

    <div class="box" style="background: #FFE8CE;">
        <h3>Net Income</h3>
        <p>
            The earnings per share are computed by dividing the net income figure by the number of weighted average
            shares outstanding. With 7.7 billion outstanding shares of Company, its EPS comes to $16.571 billion/7.7
            billion = $2.15 per share.2? With Company W having 2.995 billion outstanding shares, its EPS comes to $3.29
            per share.
